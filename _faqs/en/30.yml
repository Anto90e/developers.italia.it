title: How do you choose a project's maintainer?
text: >
  As in every community built around an open source project, the *maintainer*
  of the project is chosen based on its technical expertise, its knowledge of
  the project and the level of partecipation in the community itself. Often, in
  the context of big projects, they receive a compensation since they put
  huge efforts in terms of time and resources to contribute to the project
  itself. A *maintainer* is not only a supervisor but he must also be the
  first in terms of quantity and quality of the contribution. Our goal is that
  all the projects in Developers Italia have always an active maintainer which
  can lead the community and be a constant reference to the developers.
