title: What's the meaning of "project's maintainer"?
text: >
  In this website for "maintainer" we mean the people in charge of writing the
  source code, the documentation, and the examples of the projects.
  Furthermore, they are in charge of interacting with the developers' community
  supporting the adoption of the technology.  Typically the *maintainers* works
  closely with the product owner of the project and with the technical staff of
  the Public Administration. For example: PagoPA, the centralised payment system
  of the Public Administration, is a project of AgID (Agenzia per l'Italia
  Digitale). As such, the *maintainers* which you can see in Developers Italia
  will help AgID and will provide support to the community to facilitate the
  adoption of PagoPA by thousand of people, building and maintaining the
  plugins for the most common CMSes, interface libraries for Python or Ruby,
  and documentation of the APIs in technical language.
