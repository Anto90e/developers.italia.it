title: What's the goal of this website?
text: >
  The website was created to simplify and improve the interaction between the
  developers and the Public Administration, starting from some important
  projects like ANPR, the National Registry of the Resident Population, or
  SPID, the digital management system of the public identity. Until now,
  apart some rare exceptions, the central Public Administration limited itself
  on drafting laws and regulations in a non-technical bureaucratic language
  without any tool or initiatives to support the developers involved in building
  and integrating software. Developers Italia wants to fill this gap starting from
  a handful of projects which will grow in the next months. Around these
  projects we want to build a community starting from the basics: re-writing the
  documentation in a technical language, using as a publish platform the open
  source project *Read The Docs*. Moreover, we will provide development environments,
  examples, and SDKs for the most common languages and frameworks. Instead of
  using a helpdesk accessible only by phone, we will 
  provide a direct support via our [forum](https://forum.italia.it/), built on
  top of the open source project *Discourse* and already accessible online.
