# Information for Tech Writers 
First of all, welcome!

These ideas were contributed by our tech writers, developers and users. They
are sometimes vague or incomplete. If you wish to submit a proposal based on
these ideas, you may wish to contact the developers and find out more about the
particular suggestion you're looking at.

Being accepted as a Google Season of Docs tech writer is quite competitive.
Accepted candidates typically have thoroughly researched the technologies of
their proposed project and have been in frequent contact with potential
mentors. Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not work. On the other
hand, creating a completely new idea without first consulting potential mentors
is unlikely to work out.

When writing your proposal or asking for help from the general community of
Developers Italia don't assume everyone is familiar with the ideas here.

If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on our
[Slack](https://slack.developers.italia.it/). You can get an invite
[here](https://slack.developers.italia.it/). If you don't know who your point
of contact should be, don't be shy, there is a channel called
[#welcome](https://developersitalia.slack.com/messages/C8U3ZSM5M) just for
this!

## Open ideas

Well prepared proposals from capable tech writers have an outstanding chance of
getting selected. We consider proposals for all skill levels ranging from
simple to crazy hard and everything in between. Introduce yourself, and we'll
help you plan one right for you.

Remember that project descriptions are just initial ideas. You must expand with
considerably more detail. Change the goals to fit your experience and
interests.

**Note for the community**.
Each project on the Ideas list should include:
1. a project title/description;
2. more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences);
3. expected outcomes;
4. skills required/preferred;
5. possible mentors.

And, if possible, an *easy, medium or hard* rating of each project.

                <b>CIE</b>, the new <b>Electronic Identity Card</b>, is more than
                a simple piece of plastic: you can both connect and communicate
                via NFC, use it to cross ticket barriers or to obtain an SSL
                certificate connected to your identity. In order to obtain
                a broader adoption in the developers sphere, some technical
                documentation has to be written. In particular, a getting
                started manual related to the creation of an <i>Advanced
                Electronic Signature</i> exploiting the CIE functionalities may
                have a great impact.

                <b>Mentor:</b> project leaders and developers involved in the

                a single credential system, with a verified identity, that can
                be integrated on public, but also private websites according to
                the SAML standard. A set of tools like, e.g., SDKs and testing
                environments, have been developed by the Team and the community
                members. However, in order to have a broad adoption of such
                tools, it is necessary to write solid technical documentation.

                work on with Developers Italia but that is not among the ideas
                below? That's cool. We love that! But please do us a
                favor: Get in touch with a mentor early on and make sure your
                project is realistic and within the scope of Developers Italia.
                That will spare you and us a lot of frustration.
                <br />
                <b>Mentor:</b> Propose your idea and ask who in Developers
                Italia is interested in what you want to work on and approach
                them. If you are unsure you can always ask in <a
