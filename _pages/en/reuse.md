Articles [68](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/codice-amministrazione-digitale-docs/it/v2017-12-13/_rst/capo6_art68.html) and [69](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/codice-amministrazione-digitale-docs/it/v2017-12-13/_rst/capo6_art69.html) of the Italian *Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale* discipline how a Public Administration can acquire software and establish the obligation to release the software developed or commissioned with an open license.

The [Guidelines]({{ site.url_lineeguidariuso }}) issued by the *Agenzia per
l'Italia Digitale* (currently being published in Gazzetta Ufficiale) describe
 such process in detail.
